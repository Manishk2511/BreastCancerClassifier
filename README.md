# BreastCancerClassifier
Classifying whether the breast cancer is malign or benign using logistic regression.

logistic regression is a linear regression which divides malign and benign cancer patients using straight line.
logistic regression is based on simple linear regression on which certain formualas are applied to smooth the curve of prediction and
fitting of data into curve.

it predicts the probability from which we can estimate whether it is benign of malign
like if probability of being malign is greater than or equal to 50% then it is considered as malign else benign.

this is a simple code with not so large dataset.
